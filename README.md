# Experiments for Declarative smart contracts

This repository contains the experiment scripts for experiments in FSE'22 paper 
Declarative smart contracts.


## Compile DSC programs into Solidity.

We have placed the generated Solidity programs in [dsc/contracts](dsc/contracts)
and [dsc-instruments/contracts](dsc-instruments/contracts).

You could skip this step and rerun the evaluation experiments, or
regenerate the Solidity programs yourself. To generate Solidity programs, 
please refer to the [DSC repository](https://github.com/HaoxianChen/declarative-smart-contracts) 
for instructions, and copy the generated programs into [dsc/contracts](dsc/contracts)(programs without instrumentation)
and [dsc-instruments/contracts](dsc-instruments/contracts) (with-instrumentation).

## Install dependencies

1. Install npm: please follow instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install npm for your operating system.
2. Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/): ``npm install -g ganache``
3. Install [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation/): ``npm install -g truffle``

## Reproduce experiment results in the paper

The contracts used for gas measurements, and the instructions 
are in separate sub directories.

* [Reference contracts in Solidity](solidity/)
* [Contracts generated by DSC](dsc/)
* [Contracts generated by DSC, with instrumentation for run-time verification](dsc-instruments/)
